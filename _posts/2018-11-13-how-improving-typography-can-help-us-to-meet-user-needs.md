## What is typography?
- Typography isn’t the same as "choosing a font".
- Typography is about improving the usability and readability of content.
- Typography is concerned with the layout, spacing, size, contrast, ordering and grouping of text.

## What problems does good typography solve?
Good typography can help users to;
- navigate around a page
- understand the meaning of content
- understand the relationship between different bits of content

## How do we know poor typography is a real problem?
I've observed the following in usability testing;
- users get overwhelmed when presented with too much content
- users find it difficult to scan a pages and pick out information
- users squint, lean closer to the screen and complain about small text
- strong headings, clear and generous spacing and larger text helps users to scan text and find specific bits

## How can we tell if better typography is solving the problem?
Through usability testing and collecting feedback, it should be possible to observe that;
- users are able to find the content they are looking for more easily
- users find the content easier to understand
- users with low vision will be able to read content more easily
- users are able to spend longer reading content
