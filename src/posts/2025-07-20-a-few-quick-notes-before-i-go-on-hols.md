## Update on 10 August 2025

I tried to publish this 3 weeks ago, just before I went on hols. Needless to say, I got something wrong in the rush to post from my phone, so I'm publishing this a bit late.

## CSS snippet

I liked this [css snippet](https://bsky.app/profile/bell.bz/post/3ltvwqogl7k22) that Andy Bell shared. Saving it to remember later. Recommend following [Andy](https://bell.bz/) for great front-end dev tips.

> Adds a nice bit of breathing room to stuff that's anchored via URL like example.​com/#my-element

```
:target {
  scroll-margin-block-start: 2em;
}
```

## The Bear season 4

I've really enjoyed watching The Bear season 4 this week. It's so beautifully shot. They even managed to make a crappy document signing website look visually interesting.

## Non-Binary People’s Day

I learnt from cross-gov Slack that Non-Binary People’s Day was this week. Love that I can learn about things like this via the community.
