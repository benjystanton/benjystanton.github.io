This is version 3 of my user manual. If you want, you can read [version 2 (2021)](/blog/a-user-manual-for-me-version-2), and [version 1 (2018)](/blog/a-user-manual-for-me/). If you're unfamilier with the concept, check out this [blog post on user manuals by Cassie Robinson](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694).

## Conditions I like to work in
- Remote work helps me to drop my kids off at school at a sensible time, it also helps me to recharge between meetings
- I like to work in open, inclusive, multi-disciplinary teams
- I prefer structured workshops over meetings with no agenda

## The times/hours I like to work
- I drop my kids off at school at 8:45am, so I'm usually back and ready to start work by 9am(ish)
- I usually work 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday
- Some days I do school pick-up, so I can be unavailable around 3pm
- I tend to have more energy in the mornings

## The best ways to communicate with me
- I’m happy to use a mix of communication methods (face-to-face, email, Slack)
- I prefer teams who use asynchronous tools (like Slack) for most things
- You’ll get the best answers from me if I’ve got time to prepare
- I'm more likely to remember something if it's written down

## The ways I like to receive feedback
- I like demoing my work and presenting at show and tells
- I need time to prepare for feedback sessions
- And time to process them afterwards

## Things I need
- To observe user research
- Good digital tools like Trello, Slack and Google Drive
- Protected time to focus on complex tasks
- A team where I can focus on accessibility and inclusive design

## Things I struggle with
- I’m an introvert, which means too many meetings can drain me
- Long email threads with lots of contributors
- Acronyms and jargon
- Long days of back-to-back meetings

## Things I love
- My family
- Music
- The beach

## Other things to know about me
- I have 3 school aged kids (and a puppy)
- I value [boring design](https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-boring-designer) over shiny things
- I spend too much time on Twitter
