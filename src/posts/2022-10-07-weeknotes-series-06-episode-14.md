## Design Swansea

This week was Design Swansea 48. It’s a free meet-up held at the [HQ Urban Kitchen](https://hqurbankitchen.co.uk/) near the train station. It’s a really nice venue which serves good coffee, tiny rebel beers and drop bear alcohol free beers. 

Both talks were great this week. [Ryan Stephens](https://www.ryanstephens.co/) is a mindset coach that talked about persistence. 

And [Owen Friend](https://www.friendandfriends.co/) is a Cardiff based graphic designer who talked about work-life balance. 

The next meet-up will be on Thursday 10th November at 6:30pm. [Grab a free ticker on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/design-swansea-49-with-steve-kelly-zoe-angelise-tickets-433516819477).

## Finished the first round of user research

We finally finished the last user research session that had been delayed due to the queen’s passing and period of mourning.

I’m really glad we were able to get this final session in, the participant was deaf and we learnt a lot about their needs.

## Started a weekly design show the thing session

We started a weekly design meeting  between the 3 designers on my assignment. We’re all working on different platforms, so an opportunity to review and critique each other’s work will really help.

We have other similar recurring meetings for all user-centred people working with this client, but I’m really looking forward to the to chance for us to focus on interaction and service design.
