## Inclusive language

[Candi Williams shared a great post on LinkedIn about inclusive language](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7189550567046742017-Kyok/). It's a great reminder to me that there is always more I can do to choose better words.

> - ~~Dark patterns~~ Deceptive patterns
> - ~~Whitelist~~ Allow
> - ~~Blacklist~~ Deny
> - ~~Sold down the river~~ Betrayed

## The contenteditable attribute

I remembered that `contenteditable` was a thing this week. Add it to any element, e.g. the `<body>` and then you can select text in the browser and start typing to change the page content.

Really useful for quick prototyping in the browser. Any changes won't be saved anywhere, so as soon as you refresh, your changes are gone.
