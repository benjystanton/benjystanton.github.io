Here's my first submission for [Jukesie's](https://twitter.com/jukesie) [sticker stories](https://github.com/jukesie/sticker-stories/blob/master/README.md) project. I made this whilst I was working at Office for National Statistics in 2017. [Leigh Dodds](https://twitter.com/ldodds) was working there at the same time and wrote [some open data publishing principles](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2017/01/06/some-open-data-publishing-principles/).

Me and [Andy Dudfield](https://twitter.com/mr_dudders) thought it would be good to turn the principles it a series of stickers and posters. I never quite got round to make a series, but this simple design and message, printed on some rather fetching holographic metallic material was [a hit with open data Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/931869902641786880).
