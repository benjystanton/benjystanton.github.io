Switching from PNGs (Portable Network Graphics) or Icon Fonts, to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) icons. Updated on {{ last_modified_at }}.

{%
  include 'partials/image-with-caption.html'
  image:"svg-icon.png"
  caption:"The Twitter icon being edited in Figma"
  alt-text:"Screenshot of the Twitter bird being edited in a vector drawing application"
%}

## SVGs are best for icons

- SVGs are vector images
- They can be zoomed without pixelating
- Inline SVGs can be styled with CSS
- Inline SVGs are good for performance
- SVGs have accessibility advantages
- They are better than icon fonts
- [Browser support is good](https://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-html5)
- Editable using code or vector drawing applications

## Useful SVG attributes

- `height=""`
- `width=""`
- `viewBox=""`
- `aria-hidden="true"`
- `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`
- `focusable="false"`
- `aria-labelledby=""`
- `fill="currentColor"`

## Add `focusable="false"` to SVGs

[Scott O'Hara explains why and when to use `focusable="false"`](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html#svgs-that-are-decorative)

> `focusable="false"` is also used to ensure Internet Explorer won’t allow the Tab key to navigate into the SVG.

## Inline SVG performance benefits
- There is one less http request because we don't need to load an external image file
- File size is often smaller (unless the icon very complex)
- Only load what you need (instead of a whole icon font)
