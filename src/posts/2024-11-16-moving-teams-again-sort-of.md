## I’m moving team again, well sort of

I found out last Friday that I’m moving teams again. But, I’m staying in the same department and moving with some of my existing team mates, so it’s not a huge move, but it was still a bit of a surprise.

Actually I’m going to be split 50/50 between the existing service and this new one. So I’ll need to keep an eye on how the balance goes. I think next year I’ll be moving over 100%, so we’ll see if I can make it to Christmas whilst juggling both. There is a dedicated interaction designer on the existing team so it makes sense that we are given separate things to work on.

The new service is in an interesting space and it’s kinda public facing so I’m looking forward to getting stuck into the problem.

## Bluesky

Wow Bluesky really took off this week didn’t it? The US election results tipped a lot of people over the edge I think. I’m on a few starter packs so my follower count is ticking up nicely, it’s feeling very close to old Twitter.

And for now the people running it seem to be making good choices about the future roadmap. Sounds like they need to prioritise accessibility though.

## Service assessment results

We finally had our service assessment results. It wasn’t good, as feared. I was a bit annoyed whilst reading through the report, because it felt like they had missed things that we had actually done.

That is probably our fault for not communicating it well enough. And I suppose that’s the risk with service assessments, on another day, with other people in the room, we might have had a slightly  different outcome. I recognise though that ultimately there is a lot of room for improvement.

The positives are that I’m reflecting on how I can do a better job next time. I know my old team and department are doing that too.
