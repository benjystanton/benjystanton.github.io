excerpt: Remote working enables me to be a better parent, a better partner, be happier at work and to do better work.
---

After 2 days away with the team. I’m reminded that in-person workshops are often amazing (this one included).

But… joining video calls in an open plan office full of other people on video calls is a disaster for my productivity and wellbeing.

My brain literally can’t do it. I used to struggle through this way of working before, because I didn’t know any better. I thought I’d eventually “learn to cope like everyone else”.

Mandated “return to office” policies feel like a huge step backwards. Just trust and enable people to work where they feel most comfortable and productive.

Enable flexibility. Make it as inclusive as possible. Enable occasional face-to-face meetings that make the most of being together for short periods. (Please).

## What remote working means to me

I recognise that I’m very privileged. But, I need remote working. It helps me in so many ways.

### I need it because I’m

- an introvert
- a parent of school age kids
- someone who lives away from the places where most digital jobs tends to be

### It helps me to

- drive less and own fewer cars (without remote working this would be impossible where we live, because the public transport infrastructure just isn’t good enough)
- help the kids with their school run and morning routine (breakfast, getting dressed, brushing teeth, packing lunchboxes)
- be available to pick up my kids if they’re ill and need to come home in an emergency
- be more active (school run, walking the dog, pop to shops)
- do a few chores in my lunch break (like loading the dishwasher or putting clothes out to dry)
- help my partner to work full time if she wants to
- have more energy for life in the evening and weekends (see friends, exercise, help the kids with homework)
- have more focused, uninterrupted work time (if I need it)
- work for a much wider range of companies
- have access to better paid jobs
