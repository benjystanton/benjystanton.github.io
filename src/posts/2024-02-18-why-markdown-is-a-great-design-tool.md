excerpt: "Different ways I use Markdown to help me design and write. "
---

Markdown is an incredibly flexible tool that’s part of my daily working practice. Almost everything I write digitally (including this post) starts in Markdown. It’s even influenced the way I write on paper. And all of my design work starts with some form of writing.

This post by John Gruber is a good [intro to Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Markdown example

```
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

Paragraph with **bold** text.

- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3
```

## Markdown helps me to…

- take notes quickly (during meetings or user research sessions)
- start designing something with a "content first" approach
- focus on writing, instead of visual style
- convert notes to HTML
- write HTML quickly
- learn HTML basics (like heading levels)
- share my notes everywhere (Markdown is just plain text, so it works everywhere)
- write blog posts (it’s compatible with lots of blogging tools, like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/markdown/))
- write formatted notes in lots of apps, like [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), [Trello](https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/how-to-format-your-text-in-trello/) (although the different flavours of Markdown can be annoying)

It’s even compatible with this [lo-fi prototyping method](https://grillopress.github.io/2019/05/04/writing-shorthand.html) that Andrew Duckworth has written about (thanks to [Joe Lanman](https://joelanman.com/) for sharing that recently). 

## Tools for writing Markdown

My favourite is [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). It’s been a part of my [design toolbox](https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/my-interaction-design-tools-version-3/) for over 10 years. but any code editor or plain text writing tool will do.
