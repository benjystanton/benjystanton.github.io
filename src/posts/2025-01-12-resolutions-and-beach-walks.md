{{ excerpt }}

My only work related resolution this year is to keep blogging and weeknoting. I like the combination of self reflection and keeping up with the community. I get to share my news, and learn from/connect with others.

It's the right balance of energy-versus-reward for me. And I need to save my extra time and energy time for user research trips (which have been quite demanding over the past few months).

I don't have any grand plans to change anything about work this year. Usually at this time of year, I'm planning my next move. This time, I'm looking for stability. Contracting is still working out well, and I feel lucky to have had a continuous contract throughout 2024, doing very interesting work.

## Beach walks to blow away the cobwebs

I've been back in work this week after 2 weeks off. It was nice to have a few days off after new years to decompress before going back to work. I went on a couple of nice beach walks before the wintery weather hit, including one to Hunts Bay on the South Gower coast. It's only 20 minutes drive from my house, but it felt very remote.

I'm half way through the challenge I set myself to [visit every beach in Swansea and Gower](/blog/visiting-all-the-beaches-in-swansea-and-gower/). I also found one I didn't know about (Heatherslade Bay). So the new total is up to 40.

## User research plan

Just before Christmas, our user researcher proposed an exciting research plan that we really want to kick off soon. Although, with the busy winter period, I'm not expecting any trips will get organised until February now because recruitment is proving difficult.

To be honest, I'm really looking forward to jumping on a train and getting to speak to some people. It's been 2 months since my last research outing.

We also have a new content designer starting, so I'm looking forward to getting to working with them. The extra time gives them a chance to have an impact on the prototype too.

## Personal stuff

On a personal note, our family had some tragic news in 2024 so I'm really just hoping for a year that allows us to regroup and recover. 

It's also my wife's 40th birthday so we have a few plans to celebrate with friends and family. Including a trip to Greece in the summer (hopefully).
