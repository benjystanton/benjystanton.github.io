## Good design habits

I've been trying to get into some good design habits recently. Every Monday I go through an ever growing checklist. It's a good hack to get my brain back into gear quickly at the start of the week.

Here's some of the things I do. Often they aren't needed every week, but it's good to check.

## Create a new design history doc
- Each week I capture any big decisions or changes made to the design
- For each thing, I try and capture the following: what we changed, why we changed it, how we’ll measure success
- I've been surprised how easy this has been to maintain, each week there are at least 2 or 3 things that are worth capturing
- I try and update this throughout the week, but will check it on Friday to make sure the key things are there

## New design screenshots folder
- Alongside the design history doc, I create a new folder every week to store prototype screenshots
- I'm often creating these screenshots to share with team members and record user flows
- So the iterations are not lost, I store them in a folder each week

## Create a new weeknotes doc
- I like to write my weeknotes on the weekend, but I also like to jot down notes throughout the week to build on
- I tend to create 3 headings and add things under them, for example: work stuff, bookmarks, personal stuff

## Update my retro doc
- I have a single retro document, and each sprint I add a new subheading it to it
- Under that I have a heading for things that went well, and things that didn't go well
- I try and populate it throughout the sprint so that when the end of sprint retro rolls around, I don't have spend time trying to remember what happened

## Check if there is any user research happening this week 
- Make sure the prototype and supporting documents are ready
- Help the user researcher prep the research objectives
- Capture the research dates on a list

## Make a new prototype version if needed
- Archive the current version of the prototype and create new version to work on
- Especially if we've just finished some user research, or some big changes are planned
- Make a record of the version number and when it was merged

## Review my todo list
- I have a paper(!) todo list, that I often rewrite every week to clear off completed or unnecessary tasks
- Reading through it regularly helps me focus on what's needed

## Review the sprint board
- We have a shared Kanban board for the whole Planning Interval (PI) which lasts for about 6 sprints (or 12 weeks)
- It contains all of the user-centered design (UCD) and business analyst (BA) work 
- Checking over it every Monday helps get my head into it before we have our daily stand-up

## UCD ticket refinement
- We've just started doing a fortnightly UCD ticket refinement
- We have a whole team refinement too, but often this is focused around the software developers' work
- Me and the content designer go through each UCD ticket and make sure we know what we're doing for each one
- Often they become out of date and are no longer required, so it's quite satisfying to mark these as done or withdraw them

## Suggestions?
