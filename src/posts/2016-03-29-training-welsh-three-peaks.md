I’m currently in training for the Welsh 3 Peaks Challenge. Together with Hapo, Liam and Sami from Leadin, I’m going to be walking up the three tallest peaks in Wales (Snowdon, Cadair Idris and Pen y Fan) in 15 hours.

Our aim is to raise £1000 for [Tŷ Hafan](http://www.tyhafan.org/). You can [sponsor us here](https://www.justgiving.com/leadin-uk).

## Training walks

In effort to get fit and make sure we can complete the challenge on the day, we’ve been doing some training walks around South Wales.
