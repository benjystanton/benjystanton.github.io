## Camping at Alton Towers

On Monday we got up early to drive to Alton Towers – a 4 hour drive from Swansea. We stayed at a campsite called [Common End Farm](https://www.commonendfarmcampsite.co.uk/). It was a really nice site, with chickens wandering around and cows in the field next door. The only draw back was a busy road nearby which was loud in the night. We might try [Rue Hill Campsite](https://www.ruehillcampsite.co.uk/) next time.

We had a good day at Alton Towers, but even though some of the rides are great, I thought it was looking run down. They have a wasp problem too (seem to remember it being the same when I visited it as a teenager?). Overall, I thought Legoland was much better when we went there last year.

On the way back we drove through the nearby village of Stanton to get a photo by the sign.

## Packing for Llangennith

Today we're packing for the second half of the holiday, we're staying in a static caravan site in [Broughton](https://www.broughtonfarmcaravanpark.co.uk/), which is near Llangenith village in Gower. The weather looks hot, so I'm looking forward to lots of beach days. We're packing bikes, surf boards and a stand-up paddle board that I've borrowed.

## Beaches in Swansea and Gower

I found out recently that Swansea has about 30 beaches. I've been to lots of these, but equally I haven't heard of some of them. I'd love to visit every single one. This week we'll be very close to the last 6 or 7 on the list, hopefully we'll tick a few off.
