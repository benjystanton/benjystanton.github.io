Just a quick weeknotes this time as I'm off on hols for a few days.

## Mapping

Work was a bit up and down, but finished on a real high. A map I've been working on has been getting more attention from the wider team. The product and delivery folk in particular have been using it to help inform the roadmap they are shaping up, ready to share with the higher ups.

It's been nice to feel like I'm making an impact on the team's direction, especially as it's been a bit difficult to get good traction with any hands-on interaction design type work.

## Being paid weekly as a contractor

My current contract means that I'm being paid every week. I was a bit apprehensive about it initially, but I think it's helping me to better manage my finances.

## Gower coastal path run

I'm waking up early tomorrow for a sunrise run from Mewslade Bay to Port Eynon, Gower. I think the run is going to be about 8K. It's also going to fill in a few gaps in [my challenge to visit all the beaches in Swansea](/blog/visiting-all-the-beaches-in-swansea-and-gower/). I think we'll pass about 9 beaches, bays and coves. Will hopefully grab some good photos.

## Caerphilly by-election

I've been keeping an eye on the Caerphilly by-election. It's been an interesting one to watch and has the potential to shed some light on what might happen in the 2026 Senedd Elections. Check out [For Wales, See Wales podcast](https://forwalesseewales.buzzsprout.com/2410605/episodes/18067657-shock-caerphilly-by-election-result) for some details.
