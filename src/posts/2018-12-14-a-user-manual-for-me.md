View my latest [user manual](/blog/a-user-manual-for-me-version-4/).

<p>I’m joining a new team in Office for National Statistics (ONS), so it seemed like a good time to finally create <a href="https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694">a user manual for me</a>.</p>

## Conditions I like to work in
- I like to work in open, inclusive environments
- I like to be embedded into multi-disciplinary agile teams
- I prefer structured meetings that allow everyone to voice their opinion and vote on the best way forward
- I like to be surrounded by good design (posters and journey maps on walls, stickers on laptops)

## The times/hours I like to work
- I live in Swansea and commute to Newport, which means I need to work an early shift in order to avoid the worst of the traffic
- 7am to 3pm are the hours I work most days
- I work best in the mornings

## The best ways to communicate with me
- I’m happy to use a mix of communication methods (face-to-face, email, Slack, Skype)
- You’ll get the best answers from me if I’ve got time to prepare

## The ways I like to receive feedback
- I love demoing my work and presenting at show and tells
- I need time to prepare for feedback sessions
- I find over-the-shoulder comments difficult to process

## Things I need
- To regularly observe user research in person
- Good digital tools like Trello, Slack and Google Drive
- The ability to have regular quiet days (no-meeting days and working-from-home days)

## Things I struggle with
- I’m an introvert, which means too many meetings can drain me
- Long email threads with lots of contributors
- Acronyms and jargon

## Things I love
- [Government design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
- Web standards
- Accessibility
- User-centred design
- Government Digital Service (GDS) service standard
- Blogging and sharing my thoughts on Twitter (let me know if anything should be kept private)

## Other things to know about me
- I have 3 young kids
- Before ONS I worked at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) on the “Tell DVLA about a medical condition or disability” service as a user experience (UX) designer
- I value [boring design](https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-boring-designer) over creating shiny things
