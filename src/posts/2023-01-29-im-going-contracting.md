Hey friends, I've decided to take the plunge and go contracting.

I'll be available from {{ site.availability }}, so if you know any interesting opportunities kicking off around then, please let me know!

## Looking for

- Lead or senior interaction design, UX (user experience) design or product design roles
- UK public sector digital or tech for good
- Remote (happy with occasional travel)
- Inside IR35
- Available {{ site.availability }}

Very happy to chat if you have other kinds of role available.

## What I can do

I'm an interaction and UX designer, with plenty of experience working in UK gov. I love iterating on HTML/CSS prototypes, and I'm focused on accessibility and inclusive design.

So, a very heartfelt thanks to…
