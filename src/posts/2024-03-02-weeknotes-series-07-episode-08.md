Super quick weeknotes this week because I want extra time to prepare for [my lightning talk at Design Swansea](https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Swansea/HQ-Urban-Kitchen/Design-Swansea-Cropped-2024/37890390/) next week.

## Breaking words in tables

I [tooted about a problem with breaking words in tables](https://mastodon.social/@benjystanton/111985483721389868).

Looks like it inspired Adrian Roselli to write a whole post about it. This is good because Adrian is the expert on accessible tables: [Techniques to Break Words by Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/02/techniques-to-break-words.html).

I’m also glad that [Sara Soueidan mentioned it on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sarasoueidan.com/post/3kmmy7lhtcx2z). Otherwise I may not have spotted it.

## Trip to Sheffield

I had a great 2.5 days away in Sheffield. It was the first time meeting many of the team in person. And even the first time seeing some people’s faces. (We’re a “video-off by default” team).

It was very productive and very fun. But I also wrote a post about why I prefer my [day-to-day work to be done remotely](https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/why-i-love-remote-work/).

## Bilingual design

[Nia Campbell](https://bsky.app/profile/niacampbell.bsky.social) is sharing a lot of really interesting work around  designing Welsh products and services. Even though I don’t speak Welsh, it’s something really close to my heart as a Welsh person who cares about well designed Welsh services.

So it’s really great to see that [Nia has started sharing weeknotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jm7DKPLaURH6GZE92vAw-FrKABnY9_B9wfVIAq1gRs4/mobilebasic) too. In her post you can find some interesting notes around [bilingual design and accessibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ky4Tqh5CvRxV4Y_qNMMFyteC-BbT77V0vUX-tIZH9F4/edit#heading=h.wo7xp55rh41p). With some really great tips via [Martin Glancy](https://twitter.com/mglancy).
