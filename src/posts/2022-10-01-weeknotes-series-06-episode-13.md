Posting from my phone again today as we’ve gone to Liverpool for a friend’s 40th. 

It’s been a week of highs and lows.

## My Gran’s funeral

It was my Gran’s funeral on Monday, a sad day but she had lived a full life. I enjoyed [hearing more about what she achieved](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/june-stanton-swansea-councillor-died-24912912).

## Probation

Some better news was that I found out I’d passed my 3 month probation at Made Tech. It’s always nice to pass milestones like that, but especially nice now as it unlocks some things like the pension scheme and my sign on bonus. Should be useful for paying our energy bill. 

## Service design in gov

I’ve been following along with the [service design in gov](https://govservicedesign.net/) news on Twitter. 

Some friends from Made Tech, [Tom](https://mobile.twitter.com/tsmz) and [Vicky](https://mobile.twitter.com/VHoughtonP), both spoke there. Looking forward to finding out more about how it went. 

Plus it was nice to hear that the work of the inclusive design team at UKHSA got a couple of mentions, from [Soh-yon Park and Claudia Hopkins](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1575590856563621888) and [Katy Beale](https://mobile.twitter.com/katybeale).
