This blog post explores the tools that I use every day for interaction design. It's an update on a post that I wrote in [2018](/blog/interaction-design-tools) and [2013](/blog/web-design-tools).

## Devices

I prefer to work on Apple stuff, I'm currently using a 14 inch 2021 Macbook Pro and an iPhone 8.

## Pen and paper

Since lockdown and remote working, I've become less fussy with what stationery I use.

After asking people on Twitter to recommend their [favorite pens](/blog/pens-for-ux-sketching-and-note-taking/) I've started using Paper Mate Flairs. I also think Pental Sign Pens are great. But my kids steal them so, I often end up with bog standard biros.

## [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

Google Drive and the Docs, Slides and Sheets tools have had some nice improvements recently! A few things seem to be "inspired" by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), like the ability to insert [chips](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10710316). Chips are special links that refer to things in your Google Workplace, like other documents, meetings or people.

It also allows you to write in [Markdown](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12014036) now which I really like, although I would prefer it if it allowed me to export in Markdown too.

It's still so far ahead of alternatives like Office 365 and Sharepoint, in terms of usability and allowing people to edit the same document at the same time.

## [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Since the last time I blogged about this (back in 2018) I've switched from Atom to Visual Studio Code for writing code. It feels very similar to Atom, but it also has a nice built in Terminal and Source Control features.

## [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)

I use Eleventy as a base for my web projects (unless there is something specific that's needed). Itâ€™s a static site generator, that was similar enough to Jekyll to allow to me switch over without too much hassle. It's quicker than Jekyll and does less out of the box, meaning it's quicker to work with.

It's similar, in a way, to the [GOV.UK prototyping kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) and I find that using both tols helps me get better at understanding the technical processes and models behind building quick prototypes and basic websites.

## [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

For personal sites and blogs I prefer to use Netlify for hosting (rather than GitHub pages or Heroku).

## [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

Chrome is an essential tool for inspecting and iterating on designs in the browser. Here are a few useful plugins too;

- [WAVE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) for checking accessibility
- [disable-HTML](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-html/lfhjgihpknekohffabeddfkmoiklonhm?hl=en) for disabling HTML, CSS or JS
- [Validity](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/validity/bbicmjjbohdfglopkidebfccilipgeif?hl=en-GB) for checking code is valid
- [45to75](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/45to75/efmppndinjbljeellfdkpghgblenbcdd) for checking line length
- [WhatFont](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en) for checking font size and line height

## [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

I feel slightly guilty for using this tool (instead of using the terminal commands) but I does everything I need (commit code, push up changes, pull down changes). It also has handy links to let me open any project in Atom, in Terminal or on the GitHub website.

## [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)

Even though I don't use Terminal for GitHub, I do use it to fire up Jekyll and run it locally. This let's me build and test web stuff locally.

## [Trello](https://trello.com)

Trello is my tool of choice for managing sprints and kanban processes. I also use it home for planning holidays and Christmas. It's especially handy if you learn the [keyboard shortcuts](https://trello.com/shortcuts) and [Markdown formatting](https://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello).

## [Slack](https://slack.com/)

Slack is amazing at helping teams to stay in touch (arguably better than Email or Skype). It's especially useful when teams don't work in the same location or during the same hours.

## [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)

iA Writer is a great stripped back text editor. I use it less these days, as Google Drive has become my starting point for most documents. But I still love iA Writer's speed and simplicity.

## [Google Inbox](https://www.google.co.uk/inbox/)

Google Inbox is being shutdown soon, but it's been my go to tool for email and todo lists for the past few years, making it central to most of the work that I do. I'm trying to wean myself back onto Gmail and Google Tasks.

I think most of all, I'm going to miss the [Trip bundles](https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/6228360?hl=en-GB).
