I’m a big fan of structured/facilitated design workshops. They can be incredibly useful for user research sessions, co-designing services with teams, and stakeholder meetings.

Practising how to run these workshops, and being able to pick and choose the right one for the right task is becoming more valuable to me as a designer as I gain experience.
