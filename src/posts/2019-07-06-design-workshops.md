I’m a big fan of structured/facilitated design workshops. They can be incredibly useful for user research sessions, co-designing services with teams, and stakeholder meetings. Updated on {{ last_modified_at }}.

Practising how to run these workshops, and being able to pick and choose the right one for the right task is becoming more valuable to me as a designer as I gain experience.
