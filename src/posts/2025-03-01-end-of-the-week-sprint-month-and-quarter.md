## End of the sprint

Lot's of things coming to an end this week. It's the end of the month so I had to put some timesheets and expenses in. You can tell from my expenses alone that it's been a busy month of travelling.

It's the end of the sprint, so I've been reflecting on how the 3rd user research round went. We managed to fit in‚Ä¶

- 6 interview / usability tests 
- observing operational areas
- a few demos of our prototype to staff that were passing by

## PI (program increment) planning 

It's nearly the end of the quarter, and our next PI (program increment) planning is round the corner. I wasn't involved with PI planning last time, but hoping to get more involved this time.

A PI is basically 3 months worth of work, that is planned across a whole program, so multiple teams can align on dependencies.

We are working on 2 work streams and only one is going into this PI, so we've got a chance to focus on 1 work stream for a sprint or 2 and make sure the tech teams have what they need. I'm also hoping to start working more closely with the tech team, rather than just chucking designs over the fence.

I haven't been officially invited to PI planning yet, and I get the sense people are a bit surprised I would even want to go. I'm hoping that what I've learnt from attending [previous PI planning](/blog/pi-planning-and-prototyping/) days will help me (and some others) get value from me being there, at least for some of it, if not the whole 2 days.

## Eryri and Gower trips

Thankfully, I do have some fun things and time off planned this month.

- We have a weekend planned in Bala in Eryri National Park with a big group of friends, including a trip to [Zip World Llechwedd](https://www.visitwales.com/activity/zip-world-llechwedd-1561448).
- I'm going to try the [beach saunas at Oxwich Bay](https://www.tysawna.co.uk/) and have some food at [Beach House](https://beachhouseoxwich.co.uk/).
- I'm planning a Gower hike with some friends. We're hoping to walk over [Rhosili Down](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/wales/rhosili-and-south-gower-coast/rhosili-down-hillend-and-beach-walk).
- A couple of gigs around Swansea (may have to skip one because there is too much going on).
- And, last but not least, my cousin is getting married. Looking forward to catching up with the whole family there.
