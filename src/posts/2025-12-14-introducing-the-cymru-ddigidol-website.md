{{ excerpt }}

Ever since [GovCamp Cymru](https://www.govcamp.cymru/) last month, I've been working on a little website with [Nia](https://medium.com/@niacampbell) and [Monika](https://mani-swiatek.medium.com/).

We wanted to create something that promoted some of the great resources that are being shared in the [Cymru Ddigidol Slack](https://cymruddigidol.slack.com/) and also help to amplify some of the weeknoters and people working in the open across Wales.

I was heavily inspired by the brilliant [X-GOVUK](https://x-govuk.org/).

So today we're sharing the [Cymru Ddigidol](https://cymruddigidol.github.io/) website. An unofficial community project to share digital resources in Wales.

We wanted to get it out early, and then improve it as we go, in the open. Sorry in advance if we've missed your blog or resource, but we'll happily consider it for a future update.

The code is up on [Github](https://github.com/cymruddigidol/cymruddigidol.github.io), so please raise issues if you see any bugs or have content suggestions. Or contact me, Nia or Monika.
