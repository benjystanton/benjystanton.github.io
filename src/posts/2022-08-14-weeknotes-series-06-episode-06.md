This week we stayed in a static caravan at [Broughton Farm](https://www.broughtonfarmcaravanpark.co.uk/), near Llangennith in Gower.

## Broughton Bay

It was very hot again, which made packing a real chore, but when we got there, the weather was perfect for some lazy beach days. The tides were on our side too, especially early on in the week. The tides go out for what feels like miles at Broughton, so it's a long walk when it's out, it can be dangerous too.

We did plenty of paddle boarding, and spotted lots of [Barrel jellyfish](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/marine/jellyfish/barrel-jellyfish) when we were out a bit deeper. There were fish swimming around and the water was incredibily clear, but there was the odd bit of sheep poo floating by to remind us we were in Gower.

## Blue Pool Bay

When the tide started to get low during the day, we walked around the headland on the beach from Broughton Bay to [Blue Pool Bay](https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/south-wales/glamorgan/blue-pool-bay.htm). It's only accessible this way when the tide is at its lowest point. You can walk down from the coastal path around the cliffs too, but it's a little steep with young kids.

## Ice cream and pizza

Gower is a lot less developed than similar streches of coast like Cornwall or even Pembrokshire, so we tend to have lazy, off-grid holidays here, but the heat meant we stuck to the nearby beaches even more than usual.

We did venture away from the camp site a few times though. I always drag the family to the [Kings Head](https://kingsheadgower.co.uk/) for at least one meal, and this week was no exception.

We drove to Penclawdd (famous for its local cockle industry) one day to pick up some supplies and grab a [GG's Ice Cream](https://www.ggsgelato.co.uk/).

The best surprise were the pizzas we had the [Gower Dough Co](https://www.gowerdough.co.uk/) pop-up at [Kennexstone camp site](https://www.gowercamping.co.uk/). They have a double decker bus serving wood fired pizzas and a converted horsebox trailer serving local beers like [Gower Gold](https://gowerbrewery.com/) and non alcoholic beers from [Drop Bear](https://www.dropbearbeers.com/). They were playing music too… it had a nice festival vibe. Definitely worth a visit again.

I tweeted [a few more photos from the whole trip in this thread](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1556899300520726528).
