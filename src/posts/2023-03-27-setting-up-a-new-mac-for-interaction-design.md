Check out my [uses](/uses) page for an up-to-date list of hardware and software that I use for interaction design.

A round up of things that I'll install first on a new Macbook. I use all of these tools regularly when designing, or require them to get setup. I've written about some of them in more detail in this other post: [my interaction design tools](/blog/my-interaction-design-tools-version-3/).
