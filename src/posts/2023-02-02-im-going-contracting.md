Hey friends, I've decided to take the plunge and go contracting.

I'll be available from {{ site.availability }}, so if you know of any interesting opportunities kicking off around then, please let me know!

## What I'm looking for

- Interaction design, UX (user experience) design or product design roles
- Lead or senior level
- Starting {{ site.availability }}
- UK public sector or tech for good
- Remote – happy with occasional travel
- Inside IR35 – would consider outside
- **Bonus points** if there's a focus on accessibility or inclusive design

Very happy to chat if you have other kinds of role available.

## What I can do

I'm an interaction / product / UX designer, with plenty of experience working in UK government. I love iterating on HTML/CSS prototypes, and I'm focused on accessibility and inclusive design.

I've worked with Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), Environment Agency (EA), Met Office, Office for National Statistics (ONS) and UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) / NHS Test and Trace.
