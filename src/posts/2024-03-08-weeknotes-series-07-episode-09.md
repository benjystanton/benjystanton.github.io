## Design Swansea Cropped

I spoke at Design Swansea on Thursday, I’ve shared my [talk slides and rough transcript](/blog/3-interaction-design-things/). I put a lot of effort it to the talk, and making it available in multiple ways, so not much energy for weeknoting today.

## Subscribing to RSS feeds

I’ve started using [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) to keep up with the blogs that I follow (again). I’ve subscribed to all the sites I have listed on my [blogroll](/blogroll) that have feeds.

You can [import my subscriptions using this OPML file](/subscriptions.xml) if you want.

## Jakob Nielsen

Jakob Nielsen’s blog post about accessibility really missed the mark.
