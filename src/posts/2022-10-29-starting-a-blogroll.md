Inspired by [Max Böck](https://mxb.dev/blogroll/), I've decided to add a [blogroll](/blogroll/) to my site. According to [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/blogroll), a blogroll is "a list of other sites that you read, are a follower of, or recommend".

With Twitter under threat from you-know-who, it's a great time to start publishing on your own domain.

Let me know your blog and I'll add it to my [blogroll](/blogroll/). My contact details are on my [home page](/). Or, add your own via a [pull request](https://github.com/benjystanton/benjystanton.github.io/blob/main/src/blogroll.md).

In particular, I'll be looking to add people posting about…

- user-centred design
- accessibility
- inclusive design
- web design
- service design in the public sector
