## Made Tech design community stuff

I got myself some tickets to the UK Gov [design system day](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/08/16/join-us-for-design-system-day-2022/) conference in September. I think the theme is inclusivity – so really looking forward to attending (remotely).

At our fortnightly designer community of practice, one of the team did a great demo on using Figma’s Google Sheets plugin to create a dynamic, data driven prototype. The speed of putting it together was impressive, much quicker than anything I could do with code.

I also joined my first interview panel at Made Tech. 

## Design assignment stuff

The user researcher on the team is planning some discovery research. We’re going to recruit a couple of people with access needs. I’m looking forward to observing during the sprint that starts on Wednesday, it’s been a while since I’ve been involved directly with user research. 

I got access to Test Flight and App Store Connect so that I can test beta releases of the app on my iPhone. I’m working with Made Tech to get access to some Android devices so that I can test that out too. 

I’ve been thinking about how to document designs. I that think making sure that I write detailed acceptance criteria will help with engineer handover (especially since I’ll be creating designs in Sketch, rather than coded prototypes).

This post from Stéphanie Walter has been a great help: [A Designer’s Guide to Documenting Accessibility & User Interactions](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/a-designers-guide-to-documenting-accessibility-user-interactions/).
