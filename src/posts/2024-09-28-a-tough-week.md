## Funeral

This week was a tough one. In work I've been getting ready to move teams and we went through an internal service assessment. At home we had some builders in to start work on the kitchen. And on Wednesday we had a funeral.

I won't share much about the funeral, it feels wrong to dwell on it, especially when others are closer to it. But I'm capturing 2 of the songs that were played at the service so that I don't forget them.

## Service assessment

The service assessment was really tough, and we faced some robust questioning. It felt unfair to face some of the questions, when perhaps we weren't empowered to solve some of the underlying issues. It was also frustrating for me that we couldn't really show how far we had come as a team, or details about the constraints we were working within.

At the end I felt completely drained, but I think that was a lot to do with the other things going on.

Hopefully the assessment result can trigger some longer term changes that will empower teams to better meat the service standard.

Personally, I'm going to be more proactive in making sure my work (and the wider team's work) is considering the whole [service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

## Interaction designer weeknotes

I've been really enjoying [Frankie](https://frankieroberto.github.io/nhsnotes/posts/week-19-platformland/) and [Owen](https://owenis.online/pages/blog/weeknotes/2024-09-20/)'s weeknotes. Especially the practical bits around interaction design and front-end development. It's really interesting to hear about their challenges, and how they tackle them, including specific examples of code and workflow practices. Thanks for sharing!
