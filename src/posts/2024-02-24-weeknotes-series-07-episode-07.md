## Almost 1500 GitHub commits

I spotted that I’ve made almost 1500 commits on GitHub for this site. The [first commit](https://github.com/benjystanton/benjystanton.github.io/commit/7e7f84513d773b4d997bfce3ff6d214662556cc2) was 9 years ago! 

Back then this site was built using Jekyll, and I was migrating across from WordPress. Some of the blog posts themselves were brought across from my old WordPress blog and the oldest was written in 2007.

I’ve also been making lots of tweaks to this site’s design recently. I’m pretty happy with how it's looking and working at the moment, even if it is still extremely vanilla. The current version of the site has been in progress since 2020.

## Now page

I’ve added a [/now](/now) page to my site. It’s inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), but it was [Simone Silvestroni](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/)’s blog where I first spotted the idea. 

I love these little ideas and concepts that spread between people’s personal blogs. ‘Now’ pages feel somewhere in-between an ‘about’ page and a ‘weeknote’. 

My ‘about’ page has become very long, like a CV. So a ‘now’ page is a short, fun(?) and more personal page about things I’m currently doing, or thinking about. 

Next, I’d like to add a [/uses](https://uses.tech/) page. As a way to document all the different software and hardware that I use as an interaction designer.

## Away day in Sheffield 

In work, it’s the end of our planning interval, so we have a 2 day team workshop in Sheffield next week. We’ll be planning the next 12 weeks / 6 sprints of work and reflecting on the past few months. 

It’s a nice change of pace, and a chance to spend some time with the team. I think it’s the first time I’ve been to Sheffield since my ONS (Office for National Statistics) days.

## [Axe-con](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/)

Axe-con was last week. It’s an online digital accessibility conference. Someone in work recommended watching these 2 talks, so I’m hoping to watch them on the 5 hour (each way) train to Sheffield! I think they’re free, as long as you register.

## Listening to 

I’ve got a couple of gigs on the horizon ([Folly Group](https://www.instagram.com/follygroupcomms/) and [Thundercat](https://ninjatune.net/artist/thundercat)). So I’m spending some time listening to their stuff in preparation.
