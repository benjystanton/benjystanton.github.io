Short weeknotes feat. prototyping, Service Design in Government, my strong tweet game and Andy Bell.

## Prototyping in code

I got stuck into my new team's [pattern library](https://github.com/ONSdigital/pattern-library-v2) and [prototyping kit](https://github.com/onsdigital/sdc-prototypes) this week. I put my headphones on and listened to Joe Cornish on 6 music. It felt good to play around with code.

## Service Design in Government

I also made some good progress with my [slides for Service Design in Government](https://govservicedesign.net/2019/sessions/index.php?session=102). I should have them finished up next week.

## Strong Twitter game

I did great at Twitter this week too. My twittering about [struggling with resilience when doing service design](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793) and a [new data sticker](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1095360463192367104) went down pretty well.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Service designers! How do you cope with the stress of feeling out of control/your depth, when you are constantly trying to breakdown the boundaries between team, departments and organisations?</p>&mdash; Benjy Stanton (@benjystanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I also became the 100th person to contribute to [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign)'s awesome [Personal sites](https://personalsit.es/) project.
