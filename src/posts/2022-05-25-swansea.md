My non-exhaustive list of nice things to do in Swansea. Mostly places that serve craft ale and coffee. And beaches. Roughly East to West.

## Marina and SA1 waterfront

![2 Beer Riff pint glasses on a table](/images/beer-riff.jpg)

- [Beer Riff](https://beerriffbrewing.com/pages/taproom-1). Independent brewery and taproom. Relaxed. Family and doggy friendly in the day. Nice outside seating with views of the marina. Serves pizza and some snacks. Essential visit!
- [The Observatory](https://www.instagram.com/swanseaobservatory/). Unique, hipster-ish bar with good beer, brunch and amazing views over Swansea bay.

## Wind Street

- [Founders & Co](https://foundersandco.uk/). Large food hall with long benches. Lots of different street food style options. Also serves Tiny Rebel beer.
- [Flickering Light](https://en-gb.facebook.com/FlickeringLight/). Late night bar playing hip-hop and R&B, I'm probably too old to go there. Less Wind Street-y than most of Wind Street. Which is why it’s good.

## City centre

- [Swansea Market](http://www.swanseaindoormarket.co.uk/). Indoor market with bakeries, butchers and delis. It’s the law to try some cockles and laverbread. Buy from a few different places, then sit in seating area in the middle. [Storm in a Teacup](http://www.swanseaindoormarket.co.uk/market-stalls/places-to-eat/storm-in-a-teacup/) does great coffee.
- [The Bunkhouse](https://www.thebunkhouseswansea.com/). Bar and music venue.
- [Kardomah](https://www.kardomahcafe.com/). Unique cafe that feels like it hasn't changed in a hundred years. Great service and food. Definitely doesn't serve avocado on toast. Been used as a set for TV programmes like Channel 4’s [The End of the F***ing World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_F***ing_World).
- [Exist Skate Store](https://www.existskatestore.co.uk/). Independent skate shop with boards, trainers and T-shirts. Shares its space with Hobos, an excellent vintage clothes shop.

## High Street

- [Elysium](https://www.elysiumgallery.com/). Bar, music venue, gallery and artist studios.
- [Tangled Parrot](https://tangledparrot.com/). Record store.

## Bryn-y-mor and Uplands

- [Little Valley Bakery](https://www.littlevalleybakery.com/). Artisan sourdough, pasties and cakes. Has another shop near Three Cliffs Bay.
- [Hiatus](https://hiatus-store.com/). Surfing and adventure lifestyle shop. If I was rich I would buy everything.
- [Hoogah](https://www.hoogah-swansea.com/). Brunch style food and drink cafe/bar, sourced locally. Nice relaxed vibe. 
- [Noah’s Yard](https://www.facebook.com/NoahsYard). Swansea’s original hipster bar. Good beer and music. Slowly expanding to take over every building in Uplands.
- [Crafty Smuggler Coffee](https://craftysmugglercoffee.co.uk/). Good little coffee shop in Uplands. Also on Western Street which is near Bryn-y-mor area.

## Sketty

- [Square Peg](https://www.squarepeg.org.uk/). Best coffee in Swansea, as rated by me. Great brunch too. 

## Mumbles

%}

- [Croeso Lounge](https://thelounges.co.uk/croeso/) Relaxed brunch and burgers type restaurant. Family and doggy friendly. Great views of Swansea bay.
- [Joes Ice Cream](https://www.joes-icecream.com/). Swansea’s most famous ice cream parlour. Unique style of ice cream.
- [Ty Cwrw](https://www.facebook.com/tycwrwmumbles/). Little pub serving great craft beer. Nice seating on the green opposite.
- [Bracelet Bay](https://www.swansea.gov.uk/braceletbay). Small cove behind mumbles pier. Walk the headland round to Langland.
- [Langland Bay](https://www.visitwales.com/attraction/beach/langland-bay-beach-1443779). Picturesque beach, but can get very busy. Good for surf and paddle boards. Range of options for food.
- [Caswell Bay](https://www.enjoygower.com/caswell-bay). Huge bay when the tide is out. Smaller surf than Langland, so better for beginners. Nice walks in the woods behind the car park. 
- [Surfability UK](https://surfabilityukcic.org/). Provides surfing lessons at Caswell for people with additional needs due to disability, illness, injury or learning difficulties.

## Gower

- [Worm's Head, Rhosili Bay](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rhosili-and-south-gower-coast/trails/rhosili-headland-walk). Stunning cliffs that overlook Llangennith beach. Headland walk along the worm’s head is amazing, but pay attention to the tide. Gets more advanced the further you walk. But quite accessible to begin with. 
- [King's Head](https://kingsheadgower.co.uk/). Relaxed pub with good food. Sit outside the front and enjoy the sunset.
- [Llangennith Beach](https://www.visitswanseabay.com/listings/llangennith-beach/). Huge beach with good surf. Camp site and cafe nearby.
- [Blue Pool Bay](https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/south-wales/glamorgan/blue-pool-bay.htm). Remote, secluded beach. With large rock pool that you can jump into from surrounding rocks.

## Gowerton

- [Motley Pie & Coffee](https://www.motleypie.co.uk/). Great pies, cakes and coffee to takeaway. Pies come with optional sides like mushy peas and gravy.
- [Nomad Bar & Kitchen](https://www.nomadswansea.co.uk/). Small plates, bar snacks, cheese and cured meat platters, guest pale ales. Small and cosy inside, with a nice big covered area outside.


## More beaches
