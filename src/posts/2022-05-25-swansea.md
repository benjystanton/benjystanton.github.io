My non-exhaustive list of nice things to do in Swansea. Mostly places that serve pale ale, and beaches. Roughly East to West.

## Marina and SA1 Waterfront

- [Beer Riff](https://beerriffbrewing.com/pages/taproom-1). Independent brewery and taproom. Relaxed, family and doggy friendly in the day. Nice outside seating with views of the marina.

## Wind Street
- [Founders & Co](https://foundersandco.uk/). Large food hall with lots of different food options. But better than that sounds. Serves Tiny Rebel beer.
- [Flickering Light](https://en-gb.facebook.com/FlickeringLight/). Late night bar playing hip-hop and R&B, I'm probably too old to go there. Less Wind Street-y than most of Wind Street.

## City Centre
- [Swansea Market](http://www.swanseaindoormarket.co.uk/). Indoor market.
- [Kardomah](https://www.kardomahcafe.com/). Unique cafe that feels like it hasn't changed in a hundred years. Great service and nice food. Definitely doesn't serve avocado on toast. Been used as a set for TV programmes like The End of the F***ing World.
- [Exist Skate Store](https://www.existskatestore.co.uk/).

## Bryn-Y-Mor and Uplands
- [Little Valley Bakery](https://www.littlevalleybakery.com/).
- [Hoogah](https://www.hoogah-swansea.com/). Bar and kitchen.
- [Hiatus](https://hiatus-store.com/). Surf shop.
- [Noahâ€™s Yard](https://www.facebook.com/NoahsYard). Bar.

## Sketty
- [Square Peg](https://www.squarepeg.org.uk/). Best coffee in Swansea, as rated by me.

## Mumbles
- [Croeso Lounge](https://thelounges.co.uk/croeso/) Relaxed Restaurant.
- [Ty Cwrw](https://www.facebook.com/tycwrwmumbles/). Pub.
- [Joes Ice Cream](https://www.joes-icecream.com/).

## Gower
- [Worm's Head, Rhosili Bay](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rhosili-and-south-gower-coast/trails/rhosili-headland-walk).
- [King's Head](https://kingsheadgower.co.uk/). Pub.
- [Llangennith Beach](https://www.visitswanseabay.com/listings/llangennith-beach/). Great surfing beach and camp site.
- [Blue Pool Bay](https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/south-wales/glamorgan/blue-pool-bay.htm). Remote, secluded beach. With large rock pool that you can jump into from surrounding rocks.
