# Swansea

## Marina and SA1 Waterfront

My favourite place in the marina is currently [Beer Riff](https://beerriffbrewing.com/pages/taproom-1), an independent brewery and taproom that serve some great pale ales and things like that. Elsewhere the marina has a few nice walks around the docks, connecting the city centre with the beach.
