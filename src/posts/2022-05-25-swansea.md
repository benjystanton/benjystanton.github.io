My non-exhaustive list of nice things to do in Swansea. Mostly places that serve craft ale and coffee. And beaches. Roughly East to West.

## Marina and SA1 waterfront

![2 Beer Riff pint glasses on a table](/images/beer-riff.jpg)

- [Beer Riff](https://beerriffbrewing.com/). Excellent indie brewery and taproom. Relaxed. Family and dog friendly in the day. Nice outside seating with views of the marina. Serves pizza and sometimes has pop-up food trucks serving something different. Essential visit!

## Wind Street

- [Founders & Co](https://foundersandco.uk/). Large food hall with long benches. Lots of different great street food style options. Great spicy margaritas. Coffee shop at the front during the day.
- [Flickering Light](https://en-gb.facebook.com/FlickeringLight/). Late night bar playing hip-hop and R&B, I'm probably too old to go there. Less Wind Street-y than most of Wind Street. Which is why it’s good.

## City centre

- [Swansea Market](http://www.swanseaindoormarket.co.uk/). Indoor market with bakeries, butchers and delis. It’s the law to try some cockles and laverbread. Buy from a few different places, then sit in seating area in the middle. [Storm in a Teacup](http://www.swanseaindoormarket.co.uk/market-stalls/places-to-eat/storm-in-a-teacup/) does great coffee.
- [The Bunkhouse](https://www.thebunkhouseswansea.com/). Great bar and music venue. Serves Beer Riff beer. Bringing some great bands to Swansea.
- [Kardomah](https://www.kardomahcafe.com/). Unique cafe that feels like it hasn't changed in a hundred years. Great service and food. Definitely doesn't serve avocado on toast. Been used as a set for TV programmes like Channel 4’s [The End of the F***ing World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_F***ing_World).
- [Exist Skate Park and Store](https://www.existskatestore.co.uk/). Independent skate park and shop with boards, trainers and T-shirts.

## High Street

- [Hippos](https://www.instagram.com/hipposdo/). Alternative bar and music venue.
- [Elysium](https://www.elysiumgallery.com/). Bar, music venue, gallery and artist studios.
- [Tangled Parrot](https://tangledparrot.com/). Record store.
- [Basekamp](https://www.instagram.com/basekampswansea). Coffee shop.

## Bryn-y-mor and Uplands

- [Little Valley Bakery](https://www.littlevalleybakery.com/). Artisan sourdough, pasties and cakes. Has another shop near Three Cliffs Bay.
- [Hoogah](https://www.hoogah-swansea.com/). Brunch style food and drink cafe/bar, sourced locally. Nice relaxed vibe.
- [Sloth Coffee Co](https://www.instagram.com/sloth.coffee.co). Excellent little coffee shop. Up the hill from Uplands.

## Sketty

- [Square Peg](https://www.squarepeg.org.uk/). Best coffee in Swansea, as rated by me. Great brunch too.

## Mumbles

- [Joes Ice Cream](https://www.joes-icecream.com/). Swansea’s most famous ice cream parlour. Unique style of ice cream.
- [Hiatus](https://hiatus-store.com/). Surfing and adventure lifestyle shop. If I was rich I would buy everything.
- [Gower Seafood Hut and Deli](https://www.instagram.com/gowerseafoodhut). Seafood deli serving crab sandwiches. Located near the playground. Outdoor picnic benches including some that are under cover nearby.
- [Bracelet Bay](https://www.swansea.gov.uk/braceletbay). Small cove behind mumbles pier. Walk the headland round to Langland.
- [Langland Bay](https://www.visitwales.com/attraction/beach/langland-bay-beach-1443779). Picturesque beach, but can get very busy. Good for surf and paddle boards. Range of options for food.
- [Caswell Bay](https://www.enjoygower.com/caswell-bay). Huge bay when the tide is out. Smaller surf than Langland, so better for beginners. Nice walks in the woods behind the car park. 

## Gower

- [Worm's Head, Rhosili Bay](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rhosili-and-south-gower-coast/trails/rhosili-headland-walk). Stunning cliffs that overlook Llangennith beach. Headland walk along the worm’s head is amazing, but pay attention to the tide. Gets more advanced the further you walk. But quite accessible to begin with. 
- [King's Head](https://kingsheadgower.co.uk/). Relaxed pub with good food. Sit outside the front and enjoy the sunset.
- [Llangennith Beach](https://www.visitswanseabay.com/listings/llangennith-beach/). Huge beach with good surf. Camp site and cafe nearby.
- [Blue Pool Bay](https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/south-wales/glamorgan/blue-pool-bay.htm). Remote, secluded beach. With large rock pool that you can jump into from surrounding rocks. Tides can be dangerous so check local information.
- [Britannia Inn](https://www.britanniagower.com/). Beautiful old pub with great food and stunning views across the estuary. Some playground stuff for little kids.

## Gowerton

- [Motley Pie & Coffee](https://www.motleypie.co.uk/). Great pies, cakes and coffee to takeaway. Pies come with optional sides like mushy peas and gravy.
- [Nomad Bar & Kitchen](https://www.nomadswansea.co.uk/). Small plates, bar snacks, cheese and cured meat platters, guest pale ales. Small and cosy inside, with a nice big covered area outside.


## More beaches

I’ve blogged separately about [all the beaches in Swansea and Gower](/blog/visiting-all-the-beaches-in-swansea-and-gower/).
