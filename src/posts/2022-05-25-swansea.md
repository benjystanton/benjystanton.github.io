My non-exhaustive list of nice things to do in Swansea. Mostly places that serve pale ale. And beaches. Roughly East to West.

## Marina and SA1 Waterfront
- [Beer Riff](https://beerriffbrewing.com/pages/taproom-1). Independent brewery and taproom. Relaxed, family and doggy friendly in the day. Nice outside seating with views of the marina.

## Wind Street
- [Founders & Co](https://foundersandco.uk/). Large food hall with lots of different food options. But better than that sounds. Serves Tiny Rebel beer.
- [Flickering Light](https://en-gb.facebook.com/FlickeringLight/). Late night bar playing hip-hop and R&B, I'm probably too old to go there. Less Wind Street-y than most of Wind Street.

## City Centre
- [Swansea Market](http://www.swanseaindoormarket.co.uk/). Indoor market with bakeries, butchers and delis. It’s the law to try some cockles and laverbread.
- [Kardomah](https://www.kardomahcafe.com/). Unique cafe that feels like it hasn't changed in a hundred years. Great service and nice food. Definitely doesn't serve avocado on toast. Been used as a set for TV programmes like The End of the F***ing World.
- [Exist Skate Store](https://www.existskatestore.co.uk/). Independent skate shop with boards, trainers and T-shirts. Shares its space with Hobos, an excellent vintage clothes shop. 

## Bryn-Y-Mor and Uplands
- [Little Valley Bakery](https://www.littlevalleybakery.com/). Artisan sourdough, pasties and cakes. Has another shop near Three Cliffs Bay. 
- [Hoogah](https://www.hoogah-swansea.com/). Brunch style food and drink, sourced locally. Nice relaxed vibe.
- [Hiatus](https://hiatus-store.com/). Surfing and adventure lifestyle shop. If I was rich I would buy everything. 
- [Noah’s Yard](https://www.facebook.com/NoahsYard). Swansea original hipster bar. Good beer and music.

## Sketty
- [Square Peg](https://www.squarepeg.org.uk/). Best coffee in Swansea, as rated by me. Great brunch too. 

## Mumbles
- [Croeso Lounge](https://thelounges.co.uk/croeso/) Relaxed brunch and burgers type restaurant. Family and doggy friendly. Great views of Swansea bay.
- [Ty Cwrw](https://www.facebook.com/tycwrwmumbles/). Little pub serving great craft beer. Nice seating on the green outside.
- [Joes Ice Cream](https://www.joes-icecream.com/).
- [Bracelet Bay](https://www.swansea.gov.uk/braceletbay).
- [Langland Bay](https://www.visitwales.com/attraction/beach/langland-bay-beach-1443779).
- [Caswell Bay](https://www.enjoygower.com/caswell-bay).
- [Surfability UK](https://surfabilityukcic.org/). Provides surfing lessons and experiences for people with additional needs due to disability, illness, injury or learning difficulties.

## Gower
- [Worm's Head, Rhosili Bay](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rhosili-and-south-gower-coast/trails/rhosili-headland-walk).
- [King's Head](https://kingsheadgower.co.uk/). Pub.
- [Llangennith Beach](https://www.visitswanseabay.com/listings/llangennith-beach/). Great surfing beach and camp site.
- [Blue Pool Bay](https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/south-wales/glamorgan/blue-pool-bay.htm). Remote, secluded beach. With large rock pool that you can jump into from surrounding rocks.
