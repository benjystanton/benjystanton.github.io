I'm looking for a good solution for marking up semantic, accessible and responsive SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics). The SVG is a complex diagram, like a chart or a map, that needs to have a title, a subtitle and a source link.

## Example

{% include partials/figure.html %}

```
{% include partials/figure.html %}
```
