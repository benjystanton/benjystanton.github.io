1. **Design** – White, all caps text on black background. Part of the [GOV.UK Design System Day](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/08/16/join-us-for-design-system-day-2022/) swag.
2. **Work Together, Super Friendly** – Red and blue text, custom hand-drawn lettering, surrounded by blue stars. From [SuperFriendly](https://superfriendly.com/).
3. **Be Inclusive** – Black text on white background. Above each letter, hands spell the letters out in sign language. I think it's American Sign Language (ASL). From [RedBubble](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Be-Inclusive-ASL-by-amyhutchison/57273663.EJUG5).
4. **Weirdo** – Green, pink and yellow hand-drawn text. Behind the text, a black cat peers over the top. By [Gemma Correll](https://www.badgebomb.com/products/weirdo-cat-sticker). I added 2 blue rectangles to give the impression of frowning eyebrows.
