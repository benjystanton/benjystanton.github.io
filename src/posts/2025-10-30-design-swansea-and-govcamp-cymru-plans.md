{{ excerpt }}

I’ve been away for most of this week so I don’t have much work stuff to report on, but I’m looking forward to a few extra curricular things next week. 

## Design Swansea

I’m going to watch my friend [Dylan](https://www.fourwaves.media/) talk at [Design Swansea](https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Swansea/Urban-HQ/Design-Swansea-78---Omar-Idris--Dylan-Tucker/41436722/) on Thursday 6 November. I haven’t been for ages, but I’m really looking forward to this next one. It’s always a great meet-up. 

## GovCamp Cymru

Then, I’m going to my first ever [GovCamp Cymru](https://www.govcamp.cymru/) on Friday 7 November. I’ve been inspired by the work that people like [Nia](https://medium.com/@niacampbell), [Ann](https://annkempster.com/) and [Heledd](https://bsky.app/profile/helivans.bsky.social) are doing in Wales. 

It feels like an exciting time for public sector digital in Wales. Not to mention the great work that [CDPS (Centre for Digital Public Services)](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/home) are doing.

So, I’m keen to see some of that up close and meet other like-minded people. Hopefully see a few people there, say hello if you’re about.
