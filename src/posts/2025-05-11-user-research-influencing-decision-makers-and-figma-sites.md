## User research in Bristol 

This week flew by, starting off with the bank holiday Monday, then we went straight into 2 days of user research in Bristol. 

This is the 4th round of user research we’ve done on the service. We did 7 semi-moderated interviews, with usability testing of hi-fi prototypes, and some ad-hoc chats around early design mockups. 

We also had a couple of sessions observing frontline staff working with the as-is product. As usual, we were located in an operational area for two days so we got to absorb a little bit of “normal” working life there too.

Spending time with the team was good too, it was nice to have some time to get to know them. 

## Influencing decision makers

I’ve been moaning a lot recently about how difficult it’s been, and how much effort it’s taking, to influence stakeholders on this service. 

But a couple of posts on LinkedIn jumped out to me this week and made me realise that influencing people is the work.

## Figma sites are not accessible 

Figma released their website building tool. A lot of people have been pointing out that it produces horrible, inaccessible code.
