## Summary

I’m an hands-on interaction designer, product designer and user experience (UX) designer. I have experience in the public and private sector. I love working with agile, multidisciplinary teams that care about user-centred design.

I love working on designs from start to finish, including:

- Defining user needs, problems and success measures
- Setting user research objectives and observing user research
- Creating and iterating on user journeys and prototypes
- Delivering production ready assets and HTML/CSS
- Accessibility checks and design QA (quality assurance)
- Documenting designs and maintaining design systems

I’ve worked with teams of different sizes and setups, including in-house, hybrid and remote. I’ve lead design teams, headed-up communities, and hired and mentored designers. 

I’m an advocate for accessibility and inclusive design. I help teams to do user research with people with access needs, and do accessibility audits. I’m passionate about making products and services that work for everyone.

I use modern communication tools (like Slack, Notion and Google Suite) and love working asynchronously.

### Interaction Designer at Swirrl
April 2019 to June 2021

At Swirrl, my main focus was helping teams at the Environment Agency (EA) to publish data on Defra’s Data Services Platform (DSP).

I conducted multiple accessibility audits and worked with EA, and their suppliers, to fix issues, create accessibility statements and produce prioritised roadmaps.

Whilst working for Leadin (a Finnish service design agency) I spent my time at Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). I worked on the “Tell DVLA about a medical condition or disability” service as a Senior UX Designer. I spent time understanding how conditions like epilepsy, Parkinson’s and low vision can affect people’s ability to drive and access digital services. I built prototypes and iterated them based on user research findings, and created reusable design patterns and style guides. This helped the service to pass its government assessments.
