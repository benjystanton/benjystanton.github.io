My name is Benjy Stanton and I’m a designer. I'm a lead designer at Made Tech. I’m based in Swansea, Wales. I care about inclusive design and accessibility.

## Summary

I’m a user experience (UX) and interaction designer with experience working in the public and private sector. I’m at my best when working in multidisciplinary teams. I design products and services within agile teams, driven by user needs.

I’ve worked with teams of different sizes and setups, including in-house, distributed and remote. I've lead design teams, headed up communities of practice, and organised design meet-ups outside of work.

I’m an advocate for accessibility and inclusive design, helping teams to do user research with people with access needs and organise external accessibility audits. I’m passionate about making services more accessible and inclusive.

May 2015 to October 2016

Whilst working for Leadin (a Finnish service design agency) I spent my time at Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). I worked on the “Tell DVLA about a medical condition or disability” service as a Senior UX Designer. I spent time understanding how conditions like epilepsy, Parkinson’s and low vision can affect people’s ability to drive and access digital services. I built prototypes and iterated them based on user research findings, and created reusable design patterns and style guides. This helped the service to pass its government assessments.
